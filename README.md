# EnergyBallShader
Shader demo for energy balls (unity package)

This demo uses C# along with Unity's shader scripting to produce an energy ball shader.
This shader comes with a few parameters that allows you to vary how it looks:

* Scale: Roughness of the surface.
* Speed: Speed at which the surface pulses.
* Seed: What seed the script uses to generate it's energy-effect.
* Light Color
* Dark Color

The C# script is only used to rotate the orbs, and move them up & down.

> Note: The original shader for this idea was made [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-unity-shaders-from-scratch/)
